# GitHub Branch Support Added to CodeMaster

## **THE PROBLEM**

CodeMaster couldn't analyze branches other than the default branch (main). When trying to review the `storage-security-fixes` branch, CodeMaster said:

> "My analyze_github_repo and read_github_file tools are designed to analyze the default branch of a repository (in your case, the main branch). They do not currently have the functionality to switch to and analyze other branches like storage-security-fixes."

## **THE FIX**

✅ **Updated both GitHub tools to support branch specification**

### Changes Made:

1. **`analyze_github_repo`** - Added `branch` parameter
   - **Before**: `analyze_github_repo(repo_url)`
   - **After**: `analyze_github_repo(repo_url, branch)`
   - Now clones from any specified branch

2. **`read_github_file`** - Added `branch` parameter
   - **Before**: `read_github_file(repo_url, file_path)`
   - **After**: `read_github_file(repo_url, file_path, branch)`
   - Now reads files from any specified branch

3. **Updated CodeMaster's instructions** to explain the new capability

## **HOW TO USE IT NOW**

### Example 1: Analyze the storage-security-fixes branch

**User**: "Analyze the storage-security-fixes branch of https://github.com/LiveRichCopilot/switch.git"

**CodeMaster will now**:
```
1. analyze_github_repo("https://github.com/LiveRichCopilot/switch.git", "storage-security-fixes")
2. Get complete file list from THAT branch
3. read_github_file("https://github.com/LiveRichCopilot/switch.git", "services/storageService.ts", "storage-security-fixes")
4. Run security/quality scans on the code from THAT branch
5. Report findings
```

### Example 2: Analyze the main branch

**User**: "Analyze https://github.com/user/repo"

**CodeMaster will**:
- Either ask which branch to analyze
- OR default to "main" if not specified

## **TECHNICAL DETAILS**

### Git Clone Command Update

**Before**:
```python
repo = Repo.clone_from(repo_url, temp_dir, depth=1)
# Always cloned default branch
```

**After**:
```python
repo = Repo.clone_from(repo_url, temp_dir, branch=branch, depth=1)
# Clones specified branch
```

### Function Signatures

```python
def analyze_github_repo(repo_url: str, branch: str, tool_context: ToolContext) -> dict:
    """
    Args:
        repo_url: GitHub repository URL
        branch: Branch name (e.g., 'main', 'storage-security-fixes', 'develop')
    """
    
def read_github_file(repo_url: str, file_path: str, branch: str, tool_context: ToolContext) -> dict:
    """
    Args:
        repo_url: GitHub repository URL
        file_path: Path within repo
        branch: Branch name (e.g., 'main', 'storage-security-fixes', 'develop')
    """
```

## **WHAT THIS ENABLES**

✅ **Review Pull Requests**
- Analyze code changes on feature branches before merging

✅ **Compare Branches**
- Check main vs. develop for differences
- Verify fixes applied on specific branches

✅ **Debug Production Issues**
- Analyze the exact code that's deployed on production branches

✅ **Code Review Workflow**
- Review `storage-security-fixes` branch
- Verify all changes are correct
- Check security/quality before merging

## **TEST IT NOW**

Go to your chat with JAi and say:

```
"Analyze the storage-security-fixes branch of https://github.com/LiveRichCopilot/switch.git and verify the security fixes were implemented correctly"
```

**Expected behavior**:
1. JAi delegates to CodeMaster
2. CodeMaster analyzes the **storage-security-fixes** branch (NOT main)
3. CodeMaster reads the 3 changed files from **that branch**
4. CodeMaster runs security/quality scans
5. CodeMaster reports findings
6. CodeMaster returns to JAi
7. JAi presents the results

## **FILES MODIFIED**

- `/Users/liverichmedia/Agent master /genesis-agent/agent_backend/jai_cortex/sub_agents/code_master.py`
  - Updated `analyze_github_repo` function (added branch parameter)
  - Updated `read_github_file` function (added branch parameter)
  - Updated instructions with branch examples

## **STATUS**

✅ **FIXED** - CodeMaster can now analyze ANY branch
✅ **SERVER RESTARTED** - Running at http://localhost:8000
✅ **READY TO TEST** - Try analyzing the storage-security-fixes branch!

**Date**: Oct 2, 2025
**Issue**: CodeMaster couldn't see non-default branches
**Root Cause**: Missing `branch` parameter in Git clone commands
**Solution**: Added branch support to both GitHub tools
**Status**: ✅ Fixed and deployed
