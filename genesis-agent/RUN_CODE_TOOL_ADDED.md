# ‚ö° Run Code Tool Added to JAi

**Date**: October 2, 2025  
**Issue**: JAi tried to use `run_code` but didn't have that tool  
**Solution**: Built real code execution tools  

---

## ‚úÖ What I Added

### 1. Code Executor Module (`code_executor.py`)

**Two new functions**:

#### `execute_python_code(code, timeout=30)`
- Runs Python code and returns actual results
- Shows stdout, stderr, exit code
- 30 second timeout for safety
- Real execution, not simulation

#### `read_file_content(filepath)`
- Reads any file and shows contents
- Returns file size, line count
- Perfect for verification

---

### 2. Added to JAi's Toolkit

JAi now has **13 tools** (was 11):

**New Tools**:
8. **execute_python_code** - ‚ö° RUN CODE - Execute Python and see results
9. **read_file_content** - üìÑ READ FILES - Read and verify file contents

---

## üéØ What This Enables

### Before:
```
JAi: "I see in the logs that the file was created"
User: "But did it actually work?"
JAi: "Based on the execution output..."
```

### After:
```
JAi: "Let me verify by actually reading the file"
JAi uses: execute_python_code() or read_file_content()
JAi: "Here's the actual file content: [shows real data]"
User: "Now I can see it actually worked!"
```

---

## üß™ Testing Example

JAi can now do this:

```python
# JAi runs this code
code = """
with open('test_run.txt', 'r') as f:
    print(f.read())
"""

result = execute_python_code(code)
print(result['output'])
```

**Returns the ACTUAL file contents**, not logs or assumptions.

---

## ‚úÖ Server Status

- ‚úÖ Tools added to agent.py
- ‚úÖ Server restarted
- ‚úÖ Running at http://localhost:8000
- ‚úÖ JAi now has `execute_python_code` and `read_file_content`

---

## üìù What to Tell JAi

```
I've added two new tools for you:
1. execute_python_code - Run Python code and show actual results
2. read_file_content - Read files and verify contents

Now you can ACTUALLY verify the autonomous engine test worked by reading the file it created.
```

**This is REAL verification, not assumptions.** ‚úÖ
