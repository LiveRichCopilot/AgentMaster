## 🚀 Run This:

```bash
cd "/Users/liverichmedia/Agent master /genesis-agent/agent_backend/autonomous_engine"
python3 autonomous_engine.py
```

## ✅ Success Looks Like:

🚀 AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION STARTED
🎯 Goal decomposed into 1 tasks
▶️  Starting task: Create file: hello.txt
📄 Created file: hello.txt
✅ Task completed: Create file: hello.txt
✅ AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION COMPLETE
```

## 🔍 Verify:

```bash
cat autonomous_workspace/hello.txt
```

Should contain:
