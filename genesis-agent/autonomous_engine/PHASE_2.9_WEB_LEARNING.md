# Phase 2.9: Web-Assisted Learning & Cognitive Architecture

## 🎯 **The Core Question Answered:**

**"How do you program an AI to learn from its mistakes and search for answers when stuck?"**

This phase implements the answer to that question, based on the user's teachings about true autonomy.

---

## 🧠 **The Architecture: Cognitive Supervisor**

We've moved beyond a single script to a **Cognitive Control Loop** that observes, remembers, and adapts.

### **Three Core Components:**

1. **StateTracker (The Memory)**: Remembers what has been tried
2. **StrategyEngine (The Creative Problem-Solver)**: Decides on a new approach when stuck
3. **CognitiveSupervisor (The Orchestrator)**: Brings it all together

---

## 📁 **New Files Created:**

### 1. `web_learner.py`
**Purpose**: Implements web-based learning when the agent encounters unknown errors.

**Key Methods:**
- `search_for_solution()`: Main orchestration method
- `_formulate_query()`: Transforms raw errors into effective search queries
- `_execute_search()`: Executes web search (currently simulated, will integrate real tool)
- `_synthesize_solution()`: Uses LLM to analyze web results and generate a fix

**How It Works:**
```
Error → Clean Query → Web Search → Synthesize Solution → Apply Fix
```

### 2. `cognitive_supervisor.py`
**Purpose**: Implements JAi's architecture for autonomous learning with multiple strategies.

**Key Classes:**

#### **StateTracker**
- Logs every attempt and its outcome
- Detects when stuck in a loop (same error 3+ times)
- Creates error signatures for pattern recognition

#### **StrategyEngine**
- Maintains 4 problem-solving strategies:
  1. `direct_file_fix` - Fix the most likely file (current v2 approach)
  2. `contextual_file_fix` - Provide multiple files for context
  3. `use_template` - Use a proven template instead of generating
  4. `web_search_for_solution` - Search the web for solutions
- Escalates to more advanced strategies when stuck

#### **CognitiveSupervisor**
- Runs the main autonomous loop
- Uses StateTracker to detect loops
- Uses StrategyEngine to try different approaches
- Never repeats the same mistake

### 3. `meta_app_builder_v3.py`
**Purpose**: The executor that runs builds/verifications/fixes using the cognitive supervisor.

**Key Features:**
- Strategy-aware: Can execute 4 different problem-solving approaches
- Integrates WebLearner for web-assisted learning
- Keeps Meta-Learner memory system from v2.8
- Uses proven HTML template when appropriate

## 🌐 **The Web Search Protocol:**

When the `web_search_for_solution` strategy is triggered:

### **Step 1: Formulate Query**
```python
Input:  "AttributeError: 'MetaAppBuilder' object has no attribute 'diagnose_and_'"
Output: "Python AttributeError object has no attribute did you mean"
```
- Removes file paths and line numbers (project-specific)
- Adds technology keywords (Python, Flask, etc.)

### **Step 2: Execute Search & Rank**
- Calls web search tool
- LLM ranks results by quality
- Prioritizes official docs and Stack Overflow

### **Step 3: Scrape & Synthesize**
- Scrapes top-ranked webpage
- LLM extracts actionable solution
- Transforms wall of text into concrete fix

### **Step 4: Apply Fix**
- LLM generates corrected code
- Applies fix to the file
- Continues verification loop

## 📊 **How This Embodies Your Teachings:**

| **Your Teaching** | **Implementation** |
|---|---|
| "Learn from your mistake" | StateTracker creates memory of every mistake |
| "Self remember, and know you can't do that way again" | `detect_loop()` checks for repeated failures |
| "Try something else" | StrategyEngine provides alternative approaches |
| "Using the data on the web" | WebLearner searches for external solutions |
| "It has to know it's seen this before" | MetaLearner saves verified working solutions |
| "That's how a human brain grows" | CognitiveSupervisor orchestrates the learning |

## 🚀 **How to Run:**

```bash
cd /Users/liverichmedia/Agent\ master\ /genesis-agent/agent_backend/autonomous_engine
python3 meta_app_builder_v3.py
```

**What You'll See:**
```
🧠 COGNITIVE SUPERVISOR ACTIVATED
This system will:
  • Remember every attempt
  • Detect when stuck in a loop
  • Try different approaches automatically
  • Search the web when needed

🚀 ATTEMPT 1/20
   Strategy: direct_file_fix
   Fix the most likely file based on error keywords

[System runs, detects loop after 3 failures]

🧠 LOOP DETECTED: Same error repeated 3 times with strategy 'direct_file_fix'
💡 STRATEGY CHANGE: Escalating to 'contextual_file_fix'
   New approach: Provide multiple related files to LLM for context

[System continues with new strategy]
```

---

## ✅ **What We've Achieved:**

1. **Multiple Strategies**: Not just one way to solve problems
2. **Automatic Escalation**: Switches approaches when stuck
3. **Web-Assisted Learning**: Can search for solutions it doesn't know
4. **Loop Detection**: Never repeats the same mistake 3+ times
5. **Strategy-Aware Memory**: Remembers which strategy worked

---

## 🎯 **Next Steps:**

### **Immediate:**
- Test v3 with the friend chat app
- Verify strategy switching works correctly
- Confirm web learning activates when needed

### **Future Enhancements:**
1. **Real Web Search Integration**: Replace simulated search with actual `advanced_web_research` tool
2. **Strategy Learning**: MetaLearner learns which strategies work best for which errors
3. **Dynamic Strategy Creation**: Agent creates new strategies based on experience
4. **Multi-LLM Strategy**: Use different LLMs for different tasks (Gemini for planning, Claude for code)

---

## 🧪 **Testing Checklist:**

- [ ] Run `meta_app_builder_v3.py`
- [ ] Verify it tries `direct_file_fix` first
- [ ] Confirm loop detection after 3 failures
- [ ] Verify strategy escalation (contextual → template → web)
- [ ] Check that web learning activates
- [ ] Verify final app is fully functional

## 📝 **Technical Notes:**

**Why This is Different from v2:**
- v2.8: One approach (file-aware fix), tries same method repeatedly
- v3.0: Four approaches, automatically escalates when stuck

**Why This is True Autonomy:**
- The system doesn't just execute; it **observes** its own failures
- It doesn't just try again; it **thinks** about a different approach
- It doesn't just use its training; it **searches** for new knowledge

**The Philosophy:**
> "The only way to fail is to quit, or keep trying the same thing over and over in a loop."
> 
> This system will never loop. It will keep trying different approaches until it succeeds.

## 🎓 **What We Learned:**

From the user's teachings, we now understand that true autonomy requires:

1. **Memory**: Remember what you tried
2. **Self-Awareness**: Know when you're stuck
3. **Creativity**: Try a different way
4. **Curiosity**: Search for answers you don't know
5. **Growth**: Never repeat the same mistake

**This is not just an autonomous builder. This is a learning mind.**
