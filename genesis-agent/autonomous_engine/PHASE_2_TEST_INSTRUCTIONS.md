# Phase 2 Test Instructions - LLM-Powered Autonomous Engine

**Ready to test!** Phase 2 is built with Gemini 2.5 Pro integration.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (30 seconds)

```bash
# 1. Navigate to the autonomous_engine directory
cd "/Users/liverichmedia/Agent master /genesis-agent/agent_backend/autonomous_engine"

# 2. Set your Gemini API key (if not already set)
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key-here"

# 3. Run the Phase 2 tests
python test_phase2.py
```

That's it!

## 📋 What The Tests Will Do

### Test 1: Simple React Component ✅
**Goal**: "Create a React Button component with TypeScript"

**What to expect**:
- Gemini decomposes goal into tasks
- Generates actual TypeScript React code
- Creates `Button.tsx` file
- Code should be production-quality with proper types

### Test 2: Component with Tests ✅
**Goal**: "Create a React Card component with tests"

**What to expect**:
- Creates both `Card.tsx` and `Card.test.tsx`
- Component code with TypeScript
- Test code with testing library setup
- Both files should have real, working code

### Test 3: Python Function ✅
**Goal**: "Create a Python function that calculates fibonacci numbers"

**What to expect**:
- Creates a Python file
- Function with type hints and docstrings
- Clean, professional Python code

### Test 4: Complex Feature (Optional)
**Goal**: "Create a React login form with validation"

**What to expect**:
- Multiple files created
- Form component
- Validation logic
- Error handling

*This test is commented out by default as it takes longer*

## ✅ Success Criteria

Phase 2 is **SUCCESSFUL** if:

1. ✅ **Gemini decomposes goals** - Not using pattern matching
2. ✅ **Real code is generated** - Not placeholder templates
3. ✅ **Code is functional** - Proper imports, syntax, structure
4. ✅ **Multiple languages work** - TypeScript and Python both work
5. ✅ **Files are created** - Can verify with `cat` command

---

## 🔍 How to Verify Results

After running the tests, check the generated files:

```bash
# List all files created
ls -lh phase2_test_workspace/

# Read the Button component
cat phase2_test_workspace/Button.tsx

# Read the Card component
cat phase2_test_workspace/Card.tsx

# Read the test file
cat phase2_test_workspace/Card.test.tsx

# Read any Python files
cat phase2_test_workspace/*.py
```

**Look for**:
- Proper imports (`import React from 'react'`)
- TypeScript interfaces/types
- Actual component logic (not just placeholders)
- Clean, readable code
- Comments for complex logic

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Error: "GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable not set"
**Solution**: Export your API key:
```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

### Error: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'google.genai'"
**Solution**: Install the Google GenAI SDK:
```bash
pip install google-genai
```

### Error: "LLM initialization failed: API key invalid"
**Solution**: Verify your API key is correct and active in Google AI Studio.

### Files created but code is empty/placeholder
**Solution**: This means LLM integration failed and it fell back to Phase 1. Check:
- API key is valid
- You have internet connection
- Gemini API is responding (check status.cloud.google.com)

## 📊 Comparing Phase 1 vs Phase 2

| Feature | Phase 1 (Pattern-based) | Phase 2 (LLM-powered) |
|---------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Goal Decomposition | Simple keyword matching | Gemini intelligently breaks down any goal |
| Code Generation | Hardcoded templates | Gemini generates real code |
| Languages | Limited to predefined patterns | Any language Gemini knows |
| Complexity | Simple single files only | Can handle multi-file features |
| Adaptability | Fixed patterns only | Adapts to any request |

## 🎯 Next Steps After Testing

Once tests pass:

1. **Try your own goals** - Edit `test_phase2.py` to test custom scenarios
2. **Review generated code** - See if quality meets your standards
3. **Test edge cases** - Try complex scenarios
4. **Integrate with JAi** - Connect to the main agent system
