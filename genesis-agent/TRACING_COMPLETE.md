# ✅ Cloud Trace Setup COMPLETE

## 🎉 What's Been Configured

Your JAi Cortex OS now has **full Cloud Trace integration** based on [Google Cloud's official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/manage/tracing).

### Changes Made

1. **✅ `jai_cortex.py`** - Wrapped agent in `AdkApp` with `enable_tracing=True`
2. **✅ `main.py`** - Updated to use traced agent with documentation
3. **✅ `CLOUD_TRACE_SETUP.md`** - Complete guide to viewing and analyzing traces
4. **✅ `scripts/view_traces.sh`** - Interactive trace viewer script
5. **✅ `scripts/setup_trace_permissions.sh`** - IAM permission setup script

## 📊 What Tracing Shows

Every request to JAi Cortex OS now creates a detailed trace showing:

### 1. **Tool Calls**
```
web_search("latest AI news") → 1.2s
save_note("Important info") → 0.3s
call_code_master("write Python function") → 3.4s
```

### 2. **Specialist Agent Delegation**
```
User: "Write a Python function"
  ├─ Gemini reasoning (1.2s)
  ├─ call_code_master invoked (3.4s)
  │   └─ CodeMaster on Vertex AI (3.2s)
  │       └─ CodeMaster's Gemini call (2.8s)
  └─ Final response (0.8s)
Total: 5.4s
```

### 3. **Performance Metrics**
- **Latency**: How long each operation takes
- **Throughput**: Requests per minute
- **Error Rate**: Failed operations
- **Tool Usage**: Which tools/specialists are used most

### 4. **Request Flow**
See the complete path from user question → agent delegation → specialist response → final answer

## 🧪 Test It Now

### 1. Send a Test Request
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Help me write a Python function to calculate Fibonacci",
    "session_id": "trace-test-001",
    "user_id": "trace-test"
  }'
```

### 2. View the Trace
Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/traces/list?project=studio-2416451423-f2d96

Filter by: `session_id: trace-test-001`

### 3. What You'll See
- ✅ Root span: chat request received
- ✅ LLM span: Gemini 2.5 Pro reasoning
- ✅ Tool span: `call_code_master` invoked
- ✅ Vertex AI span: CodeMaster specialist called
- ✅ LLM span: CodeMaster's Gemini interaction
- ✅ Response span: Final answer synthesis

**Total timeline with durations for each operation!**

## 🔐 Required Setup (One-Time)

### Grant Yourself Trace Viewer Permission

Run this script:
```bash
./scripts/setup_trace_permissions.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
# Get your email
CURRENT_USER=$(gcloud config get-value account)

# Grant Cloud Trace User role
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding studio-2416451423-f2d96 \
    --member="user:$CURRENT_USER" \
    --role="roles/cloudtrace.user"
```

**This gives you permission to view traces** (but not modify trace configuration).

---

## 📈 Long-Term Storage (Optional but Recommended)

### Export Traces to BigQuery

For analysis beyond 30 days (Cloud Trace retention limit):

```bash
# Run the setup
./scripts/view_traces.sh
# Select option 5: Setup BigQuery export
```

This creates:
- Dataset: `studio-2416451423-f2d96:agent_traces`
- Auto-exports all traces to BigQuery
- Enables SQL queries for analysis

### Example Queries

**Which specialist is used most?**
```sql
SELECT
  span_name,
  COUNT(*) as call_count
FROM `studio-2416451423-f2d96.agent_traces.cloudtrace_*`
WHERE span_name LIKE 'call_%'
GROUP BY span_name
ORDER BY call_count DESC;
```

**Average response time by tool?**
```sql
SELECT
  span_name,
  AVG(duration_ms) as avg_duration_ms
FROM `studio-2416451423-f2d96.agent_traces.cloudtrace_*`
WHERE span_name IN ('call_code_master', 'call_cloud_expert', 'web_search')
GROUP BY span_name;
```

## 🚨 Set Up Alerts (Recommended)

### Alert on Slow Responses
1. Go to Cloud Monitoring → Alerting
2. Create Policy
3. Condition: "Trace span latency"
4. Threshold: 95th percentile > 5 seconds
5. Notification: Email or Slack

### Alert on High Error Rate
1. Create Policy
2. Condition: "Trace span error rate"
3. Threshold: > 5% error rate
4. Duration: 5 minutes
5. Notification: Immediate alert

See [CLOUD_TRACE_SETUP.md](./CLOUD_TRACE_SETUP.md) for detailed alert configuration.

## 📊 What Trace Data Tells You

### 1. **Agent Delegation is Working**
When you see spans for `call_code_master`, `call_cloud_expert`, etc., it proves:
- ✅ Agent is correctly identifying when to delegate
- ✅ Specialist agents on Vertex AI are being called
- ✅ Responses are flowing back correctly

### 2. **Performance Bottlenecks**
If a trace shows `call_vision_analyzer: 12s`, you know:
- Vision analysis is slow
- Might need optimization
- Or it's processing large images

### 3. **Tool Usage Patterns**
See which tools are used most:
- `web_search`: 45% of requests
- `call_code_master`: 30% of requests
- `save_note`: 15% of requests

Helps understand user needs!

### 4. **Error Tracking**
Traces show where failures happen:
- LLM timeout?
- Specialist agent error?
- Network issue to Vertex AI?

## 💰 Cost Estimate

From [Cloud Trace pricing](https://cloud.google.com/trace/pricing):

### Free Tier
- ✅ **First 2 million spans/month = FREE**
- ✅ **30-day storage = FREE**

### Your Estimated Usage
- 1,000 queries/day
- ~5 spans per query (root + LLM + tools + specialists)
- **5,000 spans/day = 150,000/month**

**Result: WELL WITHIN FREE TIER** ✅

Even at 10,000 queries/day you'd still be free!
