- ‚úÖ Detect text styles and hierarchy
- ‚úÖ Identify color schemes
- ‚úÖ Recognize UI components

### **3. CSS Parser**
- ‚úÖ Extract actual stylesheets
- ‚úÖ Get color variables
- ‚úÖ Find font stacks
- ‚úÖ Identify grid systems

### **4. HTML Structure Analyzer**
- ‚úÖ Map page hierarchy

---

### **LEVEL 3: Competitive Design Intelligence** (6+ hours)
**What it does:**
```python
compare_designs([
    "https://stripe.com",
    "https://vercel.com", 
    "https://linear.app"
])
```

**Returns:**
- Side-by-side design comparisons
- Common patterns across sites
- Unique elements each site uses
- Trend analysis ("All 3 use dark mode, gradient buttons")
- Best practices identified
- Design recommendations for your use case
- Generated component library based on patterns

**Implementation:**
- Multiple site analysis

## üéØ MY RECOMMENDATION: **Start with LEVEL 1** (2 hours)

**Why:**
1. Quick win - working in 2 hours
2. Immediately useful - get design data from any site
3. Foundation for Levels 2 & 3
4. Low risk - doesn't break existing code

**What you get:**
```bash
# Command
JAi: "Scrape the design of stripe.com"

# Response
"‚úÖ Scraped stripe.com

## üí° REAL-WORLD WORKFLOW:

**Scenario:** You're building a landing page for your agency

**You:** "Scrape designs from stripe.com, vercel.com, and linear.app"

**JAi:** 
```
‚úÖ Analyzed 3 sites

**Common patterns:**
- Dark navy backgrounds (#0A2540, #1E1E1E, #18181B)
- Gradient purple/blue accents
- Sans-serif fonts (Inter, Camphor, system fonts)
- 3-column card grids
- Large hero text (60-80px)

**Unique elements:**
- Stripe: Animated code examples
- Vercel: Edge network visualization
- Linear: Keyboard shortcut animations

**Recommendation for your agency site:**
- Use dark background with gradient accent
- Large, bold hero text
- 3-column service showcase
- Animated interaction examples
- Clean, technical aesthetic

**Want me to generate component specs or find more examples?**
```

**You:** "Generate button component specs"

**JAi:**
```
**Button Component Specs:**

```css
.primary-button {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
  color: #ffffff;
  padding: 12px 24px;
  border-radius: 8px;
  font-size: 16px;
  font-weight: 600;
  transition: transform 0.2s;
}

.primary-button:hover {
  transform: translateY(-2px);
  box-shadow: 0 10px 25px rgba(102, 126, 234, 0.3);
}
```

Based on patterns from all 3 sites. Ready to use in your design.
```

**NOW you're building with industry-leading patterns!**
