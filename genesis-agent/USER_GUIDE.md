## 📸 **Image Upload & Analysis**

### How to Upload Images:

2. Select an image from your device (PNG, JPG, etc.)

### Image Editing with Nano Banana:
Once you upload an image:
- Ask things like: "Make this image brighter"
- "Remove the background"
- "Add a sunset effect"
- "Convert this to black and white"

Agent Master will analyze and suggest how to edit it.

**Note:** For actual image generation/editing, you'll need to enable the Google AI Image API separately.

## 💬 **Natural Language Chat**

Agent Master now talks like a **friendly human**, not a robot!

### Just Chatting:
- Say "hi", "hello", "how are you" → Get natural conversational responses
- Ask questions → Get helpful explanations
- NO technical jargon unless you ask for it

### Building Agents:
- Use words like "create", "build", "design", "make"
- Then you'll get full technical details, JSON configs, deployment plans

### Examples:
**Casual:**
```
You: "Hey, what can you do?"
Agent: "Hey! I can help you build intelligent agent systems..."
```

**Technical:**
```
You: "Build me a customer support agent"
Agent: "Here's the complete architecture..." [provides JSON, services, deployment]
```
