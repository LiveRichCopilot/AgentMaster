# Autonomous Engine - Phase 1

**Goal**: Transform JAi from a turn-based assistant into an autonomous agent that can run continuously to complete complex projects.

## What We're Building

An execution system that allows JAi to:
1. Take a high-level goal (e.g., "Build a chat app")
2. Break it into subtasks automatically
3. Execute each task
4. Self-correct when errors occur
5. Run for hours/days until completion

## Phase 1 Components (Current)

### âœ… `task_manager.py` - Task Queue & State Management
- Manages task queue (FIFO)
- Tracks completed and failed tasks
- Maintains working state (files created, commands run, etc.)
- Handles automatic retry logic
- Saves/loads state for persistence

**Status**: Complete

### ðŸ”„ `environment_tools.py` - File System & Command Execution (Next)
- Create/read/update/delete files
- Run shell commands
- Capture and interpret results

### ðŸ”„ `autonomous_engine.py` - Core Execution Loop (Next)
- The main "brain" that runs continuously
- Think â†’ Plan â†’ Act â†’ Observe cycle
- Integrates TaskManager and Environment Tools

## Architecture

```
User Goal: "Build a chat app"
         â†“
[Task Decomposition] â†’ Break into subtasks
         â†“
[Task Queue] â†’ Manage execution order
         â†“
[Execution Loop] â†’ Think â†’ Plan â†’ Act â†’ Observe
         â†“             â†‘___________________|
[Environment Tools] â†’ Execute actions (create files, run commands)
         â†“
[Self-Correction] â†’ Detect errors, add fix tasks
         â†“
Goal Achieved âœ“
```

## Progress

- [x] Task Manager (Step 1)
- [ ] Environment Tools (Step 2)
- [ ] Execution Loop (Step 3)
- [ ] Test with simple task (Step 4)
- [ ] Integrate with JAi (Step 5)

## Timeline

Building step-by-step, testing each component before moving forward.

**Current Status**: Phase 1 - Foundation âœ… Task Manager Complete
