# üé¨ TEST VIDEO ANALYSIS NOW

## Step 1: Start Your Agent

```bash
cd "/Users/liverichmedia/Agent master /genesis-agent/agent_backend"
adk dev-ui
```

**Wait for:** `Server running at http://localhost:8000`

---

## Step 2: Open in Browser

Go to: **http://localhost:8000**

---

## Step 3: Test With a Video

You have 2 options:

### Option A: Test with ANY Video (Quickest)

1. Find ANY video on your Mac (screen recording, downloaded video, etc.)
2. In the ADK dev-ui chat, type:

```
I'm going to upload a video. Please analyze the UI layout and tell me:
1. What colors are used
2. What layout structure it has
3. What UI components I see
4. Give me code to build something similar
```

3. Click the **attach/upload button** (üìé or similar icon in the chat)
4. Select your video file
5. Hit send

### Option B: Use a Screenshot First (Even Faster)

If you don't have a video ready:

1. Take a screenshot of ANY app you like (Dream Machine, your own app, anything)
2. Type in chat:

```
Analyze this UI screenshot and tell me:
1. Layout structure
2. Color palette
3. Typography details
4. Component breakdown
5. Code to replicate it (React + Tailwind)
```

3. Upload the screenshot
4. Hit send

---

## Step 4: What You Should See

JAi will:
1. Process the video/image
2. Analyze the visual content
3. Return detailed breakdown
4. Provide code structure

**Example response:**
```
I've analyzed your video. Here's what I found:

Layout Structure:
- Grid-based layout with 3 columns
- Fixed header (64px height)
- Main content area (70%)
- Sidebar (30%)

Color Palette:
- Primary: #FF6B6B
- Background: #1A1A2E
- Text: #FFFFFF

UI Components:
[List of components]

Here's the React code to build this:
[Code snippets]
```

## What If It Fails?

**Common Issues:**

### Issue 1: "No video uploaded"
- Make sure you clicked the upload button
- Video must be MP4, MOV, or similar format
- Try a smaller file (under 100MB)

### Issue 2: "Video Intelligence API error"
- The API might not be enabled in your GCP project
- Try with a screenshot instead (always works)

### Issue 3: "Timeout"
- Large videos take time
- Try a shorter video (under 1 minute)

## Screenshot Me Your Results

Once you test:
1. Take a screenshot of JAi's response
2. Send it to me
3. I'll tell you if it worked correctly

Or just tell me:
- ‚úÖ "It worked" - and what you learned
- ‚ùå "It failed" - and what error you saw

---

## Quick Test (30 seconds)

**Don't have a video ready? Do this:**

1. Open Safari/Chrome
2. Go to any website (Apple.com, YouTube, etc.)
3. Take a screenshot (`Cmd + Shift + 4`)
4. Upload to JAi
5. Ask: "Analyze this UI"

**That's it.** No filming needed. Just test if the vision analysis works.

**Ready?** Start the agent and test it. Report back what happens.
