## 🧪 **TEST IT RIGHT NOW:**

Try these queries in JAi:

### **Test 1: AI Research**
```
"Research the latest developments in AI agents and give me a comprehensive brief with sources"
```

**What will happen:**
1. 🔍 JAi searches Google for 5 relevant sources
2. 📖 Extracts full content from each article
3. 🧠 Synthesizes findings with Gemini 2.5 Pro
4. 📚 Adds [Source: 1], [Source: 2] citations
5. ✅ Returns comprehensive answer with full source list

**Time:** ~15-30 seconds (comprehensive research takes time!)

---

### **Test 2: Technology Comparison**
```
"What are the pros and cons of React vs Vue in 2025? Research multiple sources and give me a balanced analysis"
```

**What makes this different:**
- Reads FULL articles (not just snippets)
- Synthesizes MULTIPLE perspectives
- Provides BALANCED analysis
- Includes CITATIONS for every claim

---

### **Test 3: Quick Fact (Compare to simple_search)**
```
"What's the capital of France?"
```

**What will happen:**
- JAi uses `simple_search` (faster, 2-3 seconds)
- Returns quick answer without deep research
- **JAi is smart enough to pick the right tool!**

---

## 🌟 **WHAT YOU NOW HAVE:**

### **Before Web Power-Up:**
- Basic web search (Google search tool)
- 1 snippet per query
- No synthesis
- No citations
- Surface-level information

### **After Web Power-Up:**
- ✅ **Multi-source research** (5 sources by default)
- ✅ **Full content extraction** (complete articles, not snippets)
- ✅ **Intelligent synthesis** (Gemini 2.5 Pro analyzes and combines)
- ✅ **Citation tracking** (every claim is sourced)
- ✅ **Comprehensive answers** (like Perplexity, but integrated into JAi)

## 📊 **PERFORMANCE:**

| Feature | `simple_search` | `advanced_web_research` |
|---------|----------------|------------------------|
| **Speed** | 2-3 seconds | 15-30 seconds |
| **Sources** | 1 snippet | 5 full articles |
| **Synthesis** | No | Yes (Gemini 2.5 Pro) |
| **Citations** | No | Yes (full tracking) |
| **Depth** | Surface | Comprehensive |
| **Use Case** | Quick facts | Research, analysis, comparisons |

## 🎯 **WHEN JAi USES EACH TOOL:**

### **`simple_search` - Quick Facts:**
- "What's the weather?"
- "Who is X?"
- "Define Y"
- Simple questions with quick answers

### **`advanced_web_research` - Deep Research:**
- "Research X and give me a brief"
- "What are the latest developments in Y?"
- "Compare A vs B with multiple sources"
- "Give me a comprehensive analysis of Z"

**JAi automatically picks the right tool based on your question!** 🧠

## 💰 **COST BREAKDOWN:**

### **Google Custom Search API:**
- **First 100 queries/day:** FREE
- **After that:** $5 per 1000 queries
- **Your usage:** If you do 10 research queries/day, you stay FREE

### **Gemini API (already using):**
- Each research query uses ~10,000-15,000 tokens
- Cost: ~$0.01-0.02 per research query

### **Estimated Monthly Cost:**
- **Light use** (5-10 queries/day): **FREE**
- **Medium use** (50 queries/day): **~$5-10/month**
- **Heavy use** (200 queries/day): **~$30-50/month**

## 💡 **PRO TIPS:**

**Get the Best Results:**
- Be specific: "Research X and Y" works better than just "X"
- Ask for comparisons: "Compare A vs B" gets balanced analysis
- Request citations: "with sources" ensures full citation tracking
- For quick facts, just ask naturally - JAi picks the right tool

**Optimize Speed:**
- Simple questions → JAi uses `simple_search` (fast)
- Research questions → JAi uses `advanced_web_research` (thorough)
- You control the depth by how you phrase the question

**Cost Management:**
- First 100 searches/day are FREE
- Complex research queries count as 1 search (regardless of how many sources)
- Monitor usage at: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/customsearch.googleapis.com
