## üí° PRO TIPS

**Memory is Your Superpower:**
- Call `recall_project_context()` at the start of EVERY conversation
- Use `search_memory()` when user says "remember when..."
- Call `update_project_notes()` after major milestones

**Debug Before Guessing:**
- ALWAYS call `debug_deployment_failure()` when deployment fails
- NEVER guess at fixes - read the logs first
- Use `verify_before_deploy()` to catch issues early

**Coordinate Complex Tasks:**
- Use `create_execution_plan()` for multi-step tasks
- Use `pass_context_between_tools()` to share data
- Use `merge_generated_components()` to combine outputs

**Learn and Improve:**
- Use `agent_self_audit()` periodically
- Use `analyze_conversation_patterns()` to learn user preferences
- Use `optimize_existing_tool()` when tools fail repeatedly
