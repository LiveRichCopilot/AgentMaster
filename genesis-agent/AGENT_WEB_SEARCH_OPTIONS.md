# 🔍 Agent-Based Web Search: What's Actually Possible

**Date:** Oct 2, 2025  
**Research Source:** Google ADK sample agents

---

## 🎯 YOUR CORE PRINCIPLE:

> "Every tool must provide capabilities BEYOND what the LLM can do on its own."

**Current Problem:** Our web search just asks Gemini to summarize search results. That's not agent behavior - that's just LLM behavior with extra steps.

---

## 📚 WHAT REAL AGENT WEB SEARCH LOOKS LIKE:

### **1. Academic Research Agent** (from ADK samples)
**What it does BEYOND normal LLM:**
- Performs **iterative searches** with different query variations
- **Filters** results by specific criteria (publication year, citations)
- **Verifies** that papers actually cite the seminal work
- **Counts and tracks** how many results meet criteria
- **Tries different strategies** if target not met (site-specific searches, different phrasings)
- **Documents** which strategies were attempted

**Key Insight:** It ACTS on search results, not just summarizes them.

---

### **2. Brand Search Optimization Agent** (from ADK samples)
**What it does BEYOND normal LLM:**
- **Clicks** on search results and buttons
- **Enters text** into search boxes
- **Scrolls** to load more content
- **Analyzes** page structure to decide next action
- **Navigates** through multiple pages
- **Extracts specific data** (product titles, prices)

**Key Insight:** It INTERACTS with the web, not just reads it.

---

### **3. Personalized Shopping Agent** (from ADK samples)
**What it does BEYOND normal LLM:**
- **Navigates** specific websites
- **Searches** within product catalogs
- **Compares** product features
- **Maintains context** across multiple searches
- **Tracks** user behavior and preferences

**Key Insight:** It REMEMBERS and BUILDS on previous searches.

## 💡 SIMPLE ENHANCEMENTS WE CAN ADD **RIGHT NOW**:

### **Option 1: Add Result Filtering & Verification** (EASIEST)
**Complexity:** Low  
**Time:** 30 minutes  

**What it adds:**
- Filter search results by date (only last 30 days)
- Check if results actually contain specific keywords
- Verify URLs are accessible before reporting them
- Count how many results meet criteria
- Report which results were filtered out and why

**User Value:** You know the info is CURRENT and VERIFIED, not just from LLM training data.

**Code Change:** Minimal - add filtering logic to `web_searcher.py`

---

### **Option 2: Add Iterative Search Refinement** (MODERATE)
**Complexity:** Medium  
**Time:** 1 hour

**What it adds:**
- If first search gets <3 good results, try different queries automatically
- Try variations: synonyms, related terms, specific site searches
- Track which queries worked best
- Report: "Tried 3 different search strategies, found 5 relevant results"

**User Value:** More thorough research, agent doesn't give up after one search.

**Code Change:** Add query refinement logic to `web_power_orchestrator.py`

---

### **Option 3: Add Website Interaction** (ADVANCED)
**Complexity:** High  
**Time:** 3-4 hours

**What it adds:**
- Click "Load More" buttons to get more content
- Navigate to linked pages
- Fill out forms to access gated content
- Handle cookie popups and login prompts

**User Value:** Access content that simple scraping can't reach.

**Code Change:** Add Selenium/Playwright for browser automation

---

### **Option 4: Add Cross-Search Memory** (MODERATE - HIGH VALUE)
**Complexity:** Medium  
**Time:** 1 hour

**What it adds:**
- Remember previous search results in this session
- Don't re-search the same queries
- Build on previous findings: "I found X earlier, now looking for Y"
- Track which sources were most useful

**User Value:** Agent learns from your research session, doesn't repeat itself.

**Code Change:** Add session storage to `web_power_orchestrator.py`, integrate with `memory_service.py`

---

### **Option 5: Add Source Credibility Scoring** (MODERATE)
**Complexity:** Medium  
**Time:** 1 hour

**What it adds:**
- Check domain authority (is it .edu, .gov, major news site?)
- Check publication date (how recent?)
- Check if source has author/citations
- Rank sources by credibility
- Report: "3 high-credibility sources, 2 medium"

**User Value:** You know which sources to trust.

**Code Change:** Add scoring logic to `content_extractor.py`

---

## 🎯 MY RECOMMENDATION: **Start with Option 1 + 4**

**Why:** 
1. **Option 1 (Filtering)** - Makes it CLEARLY different from LLM (shows current, verified data)
2. **Option 4 (Memory)** - Makes it act like an AGENT (learns from session, doesn't repeat)

**Combined they give you:**
- Verified, current results (not just LLM knowledge)
- Session memory (true agent behavior)
- NO broken code (low-risk additions)
- Small victory (1-2 hours of work)

**Example output:**
```
"I searched 'AI trends' and found 5 verified results from the last 30 days:

1. TechCrunch (Oct 1, 2025) - High credibility [✓ Verified current]
2. ArXiv (Sept 28, 2025) - High credibility [✓ Verified current]
...

I'm storing these results in my memory. If you ask for more details, 
I won't re-search - I'll use what I already found."
```

## ❌ WHAT TO AVOID:

**Don't build:**
- Generic "summarize web pages" (LLM can already do this)
- "Search and ask Gemini" (not agent behavior)
- Complex UI features (you're building for yourself, not users)

**Do build:**
- Tools that ACCESS real-time data
- Tools that VERIFY information
- Tools that REMEMBER context
- Tools that TAKE ACTION

---

## 🔄 NEXT STEPS:

**Tell me which option(s) you want**, and I'll implement them properly:

1. ✅ **Option 1** (Filtering) - 30 min
2. ✅ **Option 4** (Memory) - 1 hour  
   **→ RECOMMENDED COMBO**

3. **Option 2** (Iterative Search) - 1 hour
4. **Option 5** (Credibility Scoring) - 1 hour
5. **Option 3** (Website Interaction) - 3-4 hours

Or:
- **Remove Web Power-Up entirely** and focus on other agent capabilities
- **Tell me a specific use case** you have, and I'll design tools for that

**Your call. What do you want to build?**
